			<h1>SCMapDB Repacker</h1>
			<hr>
			A <a href="/scmapdb/scmapdb.py">script</a> on this server downloads and repacks every map on <a href="http://scmapdb.com/">SCMapDB</a> to fix various problems, such as:
			<ul>
				<li>missing files</li>
				<li>unused files</li>
				<li>broken .res files</li>
				<li>files that override default content</li>
				<li>inconsistent folder layouts</li>
				<li>incorrectly placed/named files</li>
			</ul>
			The bulk of the work is done by <a href="https://github.com/wootguy/resguy">resguy</a>. The script runs every hour to check for updates.
			<h3><a href="log.html">Repack results</a></h3>
			A filterable list of all maps that were repacked by the tool, each with a detailed view of changes. This doubles as a working search feature for SCMapDB, which hasn't had a working search bar for several years.
			<br><br>
			<div class="warn">
			Warning: maps with scripts in them may be repacked incorrectly. 
			It's sometimes impossible to know which files a script precaches, so the repacker likely deletes more than it should. 
			</div>
			<h3><a href="pool.html">Content pool</a></h3>
			A filterable list of every file that custom maps include. Files in this pool are used to recover missing files in map archives.
			<br><br>
			Each file entry lists the map(s) that reference it. Files highlighted in red are conflicted and require a manual repack to fix.
